                                During the Fall 2019 semester, I worked with Cerner, an American supplier of information
                                health solutions, on a project as part of our Experience Studio course at Purdue
                                University. With the implementation of new communication technologies in healthcare such
                                as the electronic medical record (EMR), the quality of communication in the healthcare
                                environment has decreased. Therefore, we were encouraged to come up with a solution that
                                would bridge any disconnect in understanding between patients and healthcare providers.
                            </p>
                            <p>Given the project prompt, we focused on encouraging college students to reach out to
                                healthcare resources early at the onset of illness to better support them in their
                                recovery. From personal experience we knew that many students were not satisfied with
                                visits to the on-campus health center, Purdue University Student Health Center (PUSH).
                                This was an area of improvement we identified to help alleviate existing communication
                                problems.</p>

                            <p>I was part of a team of six UX Design students. I helped our team familiarize ourselves
                                on topics relevant to our project through extensive online research, including studying
                                current healthcare modes of communication (EMRs) and problem areas with existing
                                solutions. In doing so, I established the finalized problem statement approved
                                by sponsors as well as built a persona that accurately reflected the needs of our user
                                group.

                            <p>A user-friendly diagnosis tool implemented into PUSH’s existing patient portal for
                                students to assess whether they should schedule an in-person appointment. Similar to an
                                automated assistant, the tool guides the user to making an informed decision by asking
                                questions regarding the user’s current state of health. These questions adjust according
                                to the responses received. After enough information is acquired, the tool produces a
                                list of most plausible illnesses the user might have along with recommendations for next
                                steps.</p>

                            <p>If the tool does not believe the illness calls for an appointment, students have the
                                option to sign up for emails checking in on the student. These emails will occur at
                                regular intervals (day after, week after, etc.) asking whether the student felt better
                                after following the recommended steps. From this point, students feeling worse over time
                                will have the tool automatically schedule an appointment for them. Students can stop
                                email notifications at any time.</p>

                            <p>Since the brief given to us was open-ended, narrowing our focus was essential for us to
                                work towards tangible deliverables. Our general approach to research involved
                                individually skimming peer-reviewed articles and other online resources for
                                communication issues within healthcare, then working together to quickly delve into
                                common issues identified.
                            </p>
                            <p>From the areas we zoned in on, we decided to direct our attention toward college students
                                – and later, Purdue University students – a user group in which the majority was not in
                                regular communication with healthcare professionals. This was owing to the fact that
                                before coming to college, the student’s primary caretaker would typically be the one
                                arranging appointments.

                            <p>Our goal in sending out a <a

                                was to get a better understanding of Purdue students’
                                knowledge on healthcare before, during, and after their transition to college (including
                                insurance, medical records, medical history, etc.).
                            </p>
                            <p>We received a total of 51 responses, with the majority of responses being from 20-21 year
                                olds. In the survey, we asked participants to rate themselves on their understanding
                                about their medical insurance on a 1 to 5 scale (1 being not knowledgeable and 5 being
                                knowledgeable). The average was 2.29.</p>
                            <p>We confirmed that not understanding how to seek help from the healthcare system is a
                                problem among college students. More importantly, what makes this issue more severe is
                                that many students don’t recognize this as being a problem until too late.</p>

                            <p>To get a first look at the provider side of patient-provider communication, our team
                                interviewed a nurse practitioner at PUSH in her office setting.
                            </p>

                                <li>Cost is important to students. Since this was a major determinant in deciding to
                                    schedule an appointment, PUSH practitioners are instructed to make this information
                                    readily accessible.</li>
                                <li>Students lack proper healthcare knowledge. Many students that come in do not know
                                    what health insurance plan they’re on.</li>
                                <li>Students under-utilize their PUSH patient portal. Due to the secure nature of the
                                    tool, students do not check messages from providers consistently.</li>
                                <li>Students do not readily voice questions or concerns. Fear of looking ignorant or
                                    revealing deeply personal information can inhibit clear communication between
                                    patient and provider.</li>

                                    <p>Mia is an out-of-state, first year Purdue student. As a former high school soccer
                                        athlete and all-around, active person, Mia has always been in relatively good
                                        health. Her parents keep track of important medical files, such as vaccination
                                        records.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                        </h5>
                        <p>We built out an experience map in order to pinpoint what communication gaps Mia might have if
                            she
                            falls ill while away from home. To do this, we created a scenario in which Mia has to make a
                            decision on her own judgment whether to visit PUSH or not. The experience map was based on
                            the
                            process as it currently stands. Categories explored included emotions she might feel,
                            touchpoints along the way, the media or channel being used, goals of the stakeholders, and
                            questions and concerns Mia had throughout her journey.</p>

                        <p>The questions “What’s wrong with me?” and “What should I do?” stood out as the most urgent
                            communication gaps that needed to be solved.</p>

                                    addressed our scope by nudging Mia into action. With this solution, students would
                                    proactively initiate interactions with PUSH. In turn, PUSH would have the
                                    opportunity to
                                    better help students navigate any physical health issues they might face throughout

                            <p>This diagnosis tool implemented into PUSH’s patient portal is meant for students to make
                                the first steps toward taking care of their health. Our concept encourages
                                patient-provider communication by familiarizing students with the portal, intended to
                                address the uncertainty that comes with getting sick without the presence of caretakers.
                            </p>Because of the exploratory nature of this project, careful research and planning was
                            critical in achieving a user-centric solution. Unfortunately, our haste to scope down
                            quickly led to oversight in these areas. Nevertheless, I believe that our group was able to
                            successfully pull together a solution that addressed a real need in our community.
