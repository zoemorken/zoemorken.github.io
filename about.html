                                <p>Mia is an out-of-state, first year Purdue student. As a former high school soccer
                                    athlete and all-around, active person, Mia has always been in relatively good
                                    health. Her parents keep track of important medical files, such as vaccination
                                    records. We built out an experience map in order to pinpoint what communication gaps Mia might have if she
                                    falls ill while away from home. To do this, we created a scenario in which Mia has to make a
                                    decision on her own judgment whether to visit PUSH or not. The experience map was based on the
                                    process as it currently stands. Categories explored included emotions she might feel,
                                    touchpoints along the way, the media or channel being used, goals of the stakeholders, and
                                    questions and concerns Mia had throughout her journey.

                            <p>The concept we focused on was a tool implemented into the current PUSH portal that would
                                help students determine whether they should schedule an appointment with PUSH. This
                                addressed our scope by nudging Mia into action. With this solution, students would
                                proactively initiate interactions with PUSH. In turn, PUSH would have the opportunity to
                                better help students navigate any physical health issues they might face throughout
                                college.</p>
