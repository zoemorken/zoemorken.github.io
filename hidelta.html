              <p>HiDelta is a startup that connects entrepreneurs with expert services. I interned with a team of five
                other design students as a User Experience Intern for nine weeks (May–June 2020). Following my
                internship, I was invited to continue with HiDelta as the Lead UX / UI Designer. <span class="highlight">My role for the remainder of the summer involved leading the high-fidelity designs for a new mobile application, exploring different areas of opportunity clients could consider taking their ideas, and formally presenting my progress on a weekly basis.</span></p>

              <p>When consumers try to make a decision about what to order at a restaurant, many go through the process of browsing through reviews of different restaurants on their app of choice (e.g. Yelp, Tripadvisor), finding a restaurant with a good rating, and looking through the restaurant's menu before repeating the process. Even though this is the established method for determining where to go, knowing what to eat from the set available options is clunky and tedious. Furthermore, ratings may not accurately reflect the quality of food served: there are countless average restaurants that have one or two exceptional items. Likewise, there are many excellent restaurants serving meals that will not appeal to a customer’s particular tastes. <span class="highlight">A great deal of uncertainty remains within the decision-making process, causing consumers to stick to familiar restaurants and to order conservatively when trying a new restaurant.</span></p>

          <p><span class="highlight">Recomenu is a mobile application that aggregates all available restaurant menu items within a given geographic proximity onto a single digital menu.</span> By capturing and organizing the metadata attached to those meal items, Recomenu allows the user to browse, search, filter and sort meals according to a wide variety of detailed personal preferences and find the item that best matches their tastes and preferences. As users make selections and rate their meals over time, Recomenu will use this data to make future meal recommendations. This will lead users to discover restaurants they might not have tried otherwise. Like what iTunes and Spotify have done for the music industry (move away from Artists and Albums toward individual tracks), Recomenu will accurately build a user's personal taste profile based on individual meals.</p>

                <p>This internship was the first time I used Figma extensively. I relied on Figma tutorials and advice from senior designers to create the following setup. Please reference <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/R4WRYi3hLOy8BMsqTkQ2xt/Recomenu-Portfolio?node-id=948%3A36602" target="_blank">my Figma file</a> for more details.</p>
                <div class="font-weight-bold">Design Phase 1 Product</div>
                <p>The first round of iterations on the proposed concept. Important screens include the Recomenu homepage, individual food item pages with the ability to customize and order, and a "tastelist" page with saved, custom search categories.</p>
                <div class="font-weight-bold">Design Phase 2 Product</div>
                <p>The second round of iterations on the proposed concept. New features included an updated homepage (where users could quickly select from pickup, delivery, or dine-in), profile, and activity feed to see where people were dining in the area.</p>

              <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight fast">Communication is key:</span> With my team spread across five different time zones, it was imperative that
                  we keep aligned. To do this, we created a Scrum schedule that involved meeting with the other design
                  interns at the beginning of our weekly sprints, then showcasing our individual progress at the end of
                  the week. Daily updates were sent out asynchronously through Slack. This internship was unique in that
                  our hours were flexible, so establishing a deliverable structure beforehand provided us the
                  constraints needed to plan and execute our tasks. We quickly adapted to this new style of work, and it
                  allowed us to iterate efficiently on our tasks. Furthermore, regular incremental feedback on our work
                  in progress helped us improve as designers as we began to anticipate our stakeholder’s needs.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight fast">Don’t be afraid to start over:</span> When the first round of designs presented to HiDelta’s client by a
                  hired design agency did not meet the vision he had for his proposed application, he turned to our team
                  of interns to start from scratch. This responsibility gave us the freedom to truly focus on the user.
                  Though we still had time constraints and technical requirements to meet, the client offered us a rare
                  opportunity to transform his concept into something that could be integrated into the user’s existing
                  experience discovering new meals to enjoy. I seized this chance to experiment with different ways
                  someone could come across the app, capitalizing on innovative interactions that would expose users to
                  recommendations in novel ways.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight fast">Take the initiative:</span> In my time as lead designer, I occasionally found myself not knowing how to accomplish what was asked of me. I took it upon myself to improve my technical skills by finding resources online. This has helped me gain in self-efficacy and confidence.</li>
