                    <h2>Objective</h2>
                    <p>In the past decade, the interdisciplinary field of community informatics has emerged to address social challenges in a local context. Taking a digital civics approach, our group was tasked to identify an issue in our community (Purdue University) and create a responsive website to cater to the citizens’ needs, empowering them to confront local issues.</p>
                    <p>We chose to focus our efforts on helping Purdue students about to graduate transition into post-graduation life. From observation of others making the shift and our own graduations ahead of us, we saw meaning in acknowledging individual concerns and insecurities about the future.</p>
