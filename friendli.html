                    <h2>Objective</h2>
                    <p>In the past decade, the interdisciplinary field of community informatics has emerged to address social challenges in a local context. Taking a digital civics approach, our group was tasked to <span style="background-color: #fff2cc">identify an issue in our community (Purdue University)</span> and <span style="background-color: #fff2cc">create a responsive website to cater to the citizens’ needs</span>, empowering them to confront local issues.</p>
                    <p>We chose to focus our efforts on helping Purdue students about to graduate transition into post-graduation life. From observation of others making the shift and our own graduations ahead of us, we saw meaning in acknowledging individual concerns and insecurities about the future.</p>

                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>We designed Friendli, a web experience that would <span style="background-color: #fff2cc">facilitate deep conversations between friends by asking a daily, reflective question about their experiences and expectations leading up to graduation</span>. By keeping in consistent contact with this friend prior to graduation, Friendli would enhance the likelihood of maintaining that connection post-graduation. With someone to rely on during difficult times, the transition into life after college would be less turbulent.</p>

                        <li>Spurred the ideation process through multiple sketches of web experience, listening to others’ feedback and improving upon the overall design</li>
                        <li>Came up with and championed an activity during our co-design workshop</li>
                        <li>Gathered results through different methods of testing on prototypes I collaborated on</li>

                <h1>Data Collection</h1>
                <h2>Secondary Research</h2>
                <p>We first used secondary research to narrow our problem space, learning about who was more likely to be lonely in college and why. In order to focus in on the issue we wanted to solve, our group identified users typically prone to isolation (students graduating late, students with minor learning / physical disabilities, students from low-income backgrounds, etc.). We decided to advocate for the student with one or two close friends, specifically addressing feelings of isolation that may emerge for them after graduation.</p>
                <h2>Interviews</h2>
                <p>The goal of conducting interviews was to see how college students currently in their year before graduation perceived how their lives will look like after graduation. We compared their expectations with the experience of recent graduates.</p>
                <p>Our protocol was fairly loose with the purpose of generating a comfortable, conversational environment. Questions revolved around reflecting about their either upcoming or past graduation as well as their social support systems to further probe into the causal relationship between support from family / close friends and emotional wellbeing (as identified by secondary research). Some guiding questions were “What are your expectations?” and “How do you feel about graduating? Interviews were conducted both in-person and over video chat.</p>

                        <p>Participant’s responses were distilled into six categories: (1) negative experiences / challenges, (2) finding friends, (3) plans, (4) experiences, (5) maintaining experiences, and (6) social support. The main takeaways that fueled initial ideations drew mostly from categories 1, 2, and 4.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>(1) not ready for the future despite impending graduation</li>
                            <li>(1) lacking practical life skills</li>

                            <li>(4) social support changes</li>
                            <li>(4) geographic limits with friends made in college</li>

                <p>Insights from interviews were obtained from four recently graduated students and five students graduating Fall 2019 / Spring 2020.</p>
                  <h2>Initial Ideation</h2>
                  <p>Above are some of our first sketches. These attempts at ideation were unsuccessful, particularly because our scope was too broad at this point. Consequently, we came up with diverse ideas that didn’t quite penetrate the issue our stakeholders were facing. Through discussion of the possibilities these ideas could take us, we discovered that each came with their own set of problems we’d have to address later down the line.</p>
                  <p>To move forward, we crafted a co-design workshop in order to provide a space for people to talk about their expectations and experiences for life after graduation. From this, we hoped to obtain insights helpful in scoping down.</p>

            <div class="dataanalysis">
                <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
                <h2>Narrowed Scope</h2>
                <h4>Purdue students about to graduate need a way to prepare themselves for the social changes that occur after graduation by finding a source of stability through maintaining connections.</h4>
                <p>Looking back at our co-design, we noticed that those who were hopeful in maintaining connections would be those who had a small group of very close friends during their time in college. Therefore, our design applied to all graduating students but was dedicated to those with few, but meaningful, relationships.</p>
                <h2>Sketches</h2>
                <p>Moving forward with our established user group, we began sketching and discussing ideas. We knew we wanted to create an experience that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Allowed users to strengthen their relationships with their current friends, taking advantage of the time they have left with them in college</li>
                    <li>Wouldn’t take a lot of effort or planning to stay connected</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Merging these points together, we came up with Friendli, a web experience that would facilitate a deep conversation between friends by asking a daily, reflective question. We felt that this would be a great way to bring awareness to the possibility of losing the chance of having meaningful conversations between friends and for them to support their own friendship by partaking in the activity.</p>

                        <p>After creating our first interactive prototype, we subjected it to usability testing to see how usable / intuitive our prototype was, particularly as it pertained to the two screens on the left.</p>
                        <p>Questions and comments we received from stakeholders through testing were taken into account for iterations.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is the daily question provided by the system [or me]?</li>

                            <li>What is the archive?</li>
                            <li>The interface is misleading; it feels like a group discussion rather than a one-on-one conversation with a friend.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                        <p>It was unclear to participants that discussion generated by the daily question was not a group conversation with all their friends. We attributed this to confusing UI, and tweaked the visual layout before our next round of testing.</p>

                    <div class="friendliv2text">
                        <p>After our first round of testing, we decided to clarify the one-on-one interactions and make small changes to clear confusion about features. This prototype was put under the comparative user and teachback testing methods.</p>
                        <p>Our goal for conducting comparative user testing was to see how our old version of the prototype compared to our new version shown above. We were to gauge the differences in each by looking at quantitative metrics such as task-completion and error rates and time on task. Some insights we found are as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It took users approximately ¾ the amount of time navigating this version of the website vs. the old website prototype</li>
                            <li>Users still thought this website was a discussion forum, not a one-on-one conversation</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Teachback testing was used to see how users interpreted the purpose and functions of the website. However, there wasn’t much confusion after we described everything to our users. This form of testing did not provide as much insight as the comparative user testing.</p>
                        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                        <p>We overhauled our UI after testing our iterated prototype and took into consideration the insights from both sessions.</p>

                <h1>Summary and Design Rationale</h1>
                <p>Friendli is a website experience for soon-to-be Purdue graduates that prepares them for the social changes they will face after graduation by promoting the maintenance and strengthening of friendships during what can be an unstable time.</p>
                <p>Friendli achieves this by asking users a question pertaining to a specific milestone on their road to graduation. They are able to prepare for these different stages by reflecting on their feelings and emotions during this significant time of change. Their answer is shared with a close friend, and the two are able to reflect together, thus, creating a deeper bond between the two than they would have outside of this experience.</p>
                <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                <p>This project opened me up to the realm of digital civics and helped me become more attuned to the needs of people in the local community. Though the problem we chose to focus our efforts on (assisting students through the transition of college to work life) is an inevitable part of life for most stakeholders, we wanted to make sure they began their journey forward on the right foot. Feelings of loneliness and isolation have the power to ruin what should be an exciting transition, so I believe that what we were solving for has potential for real impact in our community.</p>
                <p>However, the process of coming up with Friendli wasn’t easy. We struggled greatly in narrowing our scope, and in my opinion, didn’t get to the level of specificity we needed with our user group. Our web experience can be improved by more scoping down, research, and iterations. Though not perfect, I grew my skillset as a UX designer, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How to properly coordinate and run a co-design workshop</li>
                    <li>Use different testing methods to our advantage, seeking out problems we wouldn’t have found otherwise</li>
                    <li>Learn how to create prototypes with online tools quickly and effectively</li>
                    <li>Code within a responsive CSS framework</li>
