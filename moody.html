              <p>In the past decade, the traditional method of designing websites (static pages with links) has largely
                been replaced with the designing of web applications. Web apps are able to engage users through dynamic
                and interactive content through external web services. Different web services supply methods for sending
                and receiving information across a network, typically from a server to a client. Through application
                programming interfaces (APIs), web developers can request content from web services to implement onto
                their web applications. Popular services such as Google, Facebook, and YouTube provide public APIs.</p>
              <p>Our task was to create a web app that called upon a public API. The final product was an interactive
                web page (HTML) styled with CSS and an API that enhanced functionality and UX of our web app. I chose to
                create my web app using Spotify's API for Developers that would allow users to generate playlists
                tailored to their current mood.</p>
              <h5 id="focus">

                <li>Chosen API: Spotify’s Web API for Developers</li>
                <li>Input: Mood / Situation (visualized as menu on the side of the screen)</li>
                <li>Output: Recommended playlist or list of songs</li>

                <div>Spotify Authorization Setup</div>
              </h5>
              <p>To start, I followed <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/"
                  target="_blank">Spotify’s quick start web API tutorial</a>. Though Spotify’s API is free, it requires
                a Spotify account to access user-related information. Therefore, it was imperative that I register my
                app according to the guide. Following the setup process, I did the following:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Register my application. I created the app under my Spotify account. After deciding on a name and
                  description, Spotify provided me with a Client ID and secret (a key to pass secure calls to Spotify
                  Accounts and Web API services).</li>
                <li>Prepare and test my environment. Following the tutorial, I downloaded and installed Node.js in order
                  to create an HTTP server on my computer. Running both server.js and app.js in Node, I was able to
                  start up a web server on my computer at port 8888. When typing in “localhost:8888,” my Chrome browser
                  made a call to a server, in which Node replied with the http request. Per the Spotify tutorial, I set
                  up the response as “Hello World.”</li>
                <li>Add Node.js into downloaded OAuth examples. I downloaded a GitHub repository with the examples
                  supplied in the tutorial.</li>
                <li>Provide the app credentials. In the app.js file (one of the files I downloaded from GitHub), I had
                  to input the Client ID, Client Secret, and Redirect URI in order to call my specific app. Going back
                  to my dashboard, I retrieved these values to get the app up and running.</li>
              </ol>
              <h5 id="functionality">
                <div>Specifying Functionality</div>
              </h5>
              <p>Following the tutorial, my API retrieved the Spotify user’s account data. This was a placeholder
                endpoint that I changed. To customize Moody, I replaced this with my chosen endpoint: <a
                  href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/browse/get-recommendations/"
                  target="_blank">/v1/recommendations</a>. Changes I made in the code were added incrementally – I
                always commented out code I thought I didn’t need, checked the browser, then deleted if everything was
                still working – to reduce the possibility of not knowing where the error occurred.</p>
              <p>Most of my changes were made on the index.html page I downloaded from GitHub. I did not make a separate
                file due to the fact that some of the components needed for authorization and access into Spotify’s API
                already existed on this page upon downloading. Therefore, the index.html page includes not only HTML,
                but some JavaScript (JS) and jQuery as well as Handlebars.js, a compiler that takes HTML and (using a
                Handlebars expression) compiles them to a JS function. For clarity, different scripts are organized in
                logical order, from the first login page to the actual web app itself.</p>
              <p>The app functions as follows:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>The user provides their credentials to log in to Spotify.</li>
                <li>The navigation menu on the left side calls an AJAX function which retrieves data from Spotify’s
                  server asynchronously (the endpoint URL is built to make the AJAX call).</li>
                <li>JSON results from the API are parsed and rendered by Handlebars into HTML.</li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <h5 id="styling">
              <div>Styling and Enhanced UX</div>
            </h5>
            <p>After getting Moody to function as intended, I styled the web app. I wanted users to be able to discover
              new songs when selecting a given mood. To do this, I followed <a
                href="https://developer.spotify.com/branding-guidelines/" target="_blank">Spotify’s branding
                guidelines</a> to help users associate the app with Spotify as well as make a navigation menu out of iOS
              emojis.</p>
            <p>Styling for Moody was done in a separate style.css file. Here, I manipulated background color, customized
              placement of the aside, generated tracks, and altered the size of the emojis. The emojis themselves are
              displayed in HTML using their unique decimal reference.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="row row-cols-1 p-3">
            <div class="h-100 border-0">
              <h2 id="reflection">
                <div>Reflection</div>
                <a class="anchorjs-link" href="#reflection" aria-label="Anchor" data-anchorjs-icon="#"></a>
              </h2>
              <p>My first experience working with an API was much more difficult than anticipated. Prior to this
                exercise, I had no background knowledge on the subject and had no idea what many of the terms thrown my
                way meant. Because each part of the process exercised different mental capabilities, I’ve broken this
                reflection into how I approached creating Moody.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Spotify Authorization Set-Up: By far the most technically challenging part. I relied heavily on
                  external sources when the tutorial didn’t make sense or wasn’t working for me. Coming into this
                  exercise, I struggled to understand what an API was, much less how I could run one. Therefore, when
                  going through the tutorial, I asked many questions: “What is Node.js? What is a local host? What is an
                  access / refresh token?” Though these terms are not as foreign to me now as they were then, I still am
                  not completely familiar with the many components in my code running behind the scenes. However, I
                  understand how everything interacts with one another, from the client-side HTML to the server-side
                  API. Additionally, I learned basic Unix commands to start the terminal.</li>
                <li>Specifying Functionality: This was also difficult, as I had limited JS and jQuery knowledge. Once I
                  had the API example set up on my computer, I began to edit and rearrange the code gradually. I saved
                  and checked the smallest of modifications in the browser to confirm everything was still running
                  properly. By doing so, I was able to reduce the amount of time spent debugging since only one change
                  was made at a time. This made running into issues easier; when I did encounter problems, I would use
                  Developer Tools to view errors (which was especially helpful when replacing user profile information
                  with track information).</li>
                <li>Styling and Enhanced UX: What I found most exciting to do besides seeing the API work for the first
                  time. Because I was already familiar with CSS, this part was relatively short and involved playing
                  around with line widths, spacing, sizing, etc. When deciding on a more meaningful way to showcase
                  information retrieved from the API, I was happy to discover that emojis had their own HTML reference.
                  I had to learn a bit of JS to have the playlist name update accordingly, but this addition enhanced
                  the overall end result.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="font-italic">Update: I am currently in the process of improving Moody's interface in order to
                further enhance the final web experience.</p>
