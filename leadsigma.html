                            <p>Based in Lenexa, Kansas, LeadSigma is a sales-tech platform supporting small businesses
                                by connecting online forms (websites, landing pages, and/or digital lead forms) to
                                business phones in order to immediately generate conversations with new customers and
                                increase conversion rates. The platform also manages actionable follow-up tasks to
                                ensure that sales teams execute the right follow-up actions at the right times.</p>

                            </h2>
                            <p>I was the Lead UI/UX Designer for LeadSigma’s UI team, driving the design of the web
                                application. LeadSigma Call Slingshot connects online contact forms with business
                                phones, and LeadSigma SalesStream creates follow-up tasks that help sales teams connect
                                with leads. Since SalesStream needed a way to display the tasks a sales representative
                                should complete in a given day, we had to create an app that allowed users different
                                ways to interact with their tasks.
                            </p>
                            <p>My responsibilities included supervising and delegating tasks to the design interns,
                                making key decisions on how features should be displayed within the app, and
                                transforming wireframes into high-fidelity, interactive prototypes for customer
                                demonstrations. As this position was remote with a hard deadline, our team relied
                                heavily on communication and organization tools such as Slack and Notion to deliver
                                quality work in a timely manner.

                            <p>After being assigned to focus on the web app, my team went to work by sketching out
                                various ways we could display the main pages. I drew inspiration from previous work
                                completed by the Purdue UX students in the Fall 2020 semester, designs from a contracted
                                product designer previously employed by LeadSigma, and online resources such as
                                Dribbble. After several rounds of sharing our sketches with CEO Scott Hansen and CTO
                                John Moses, we made necessary iterations then transitioned to using Whimsical to create
                                mockups.</p>
                            <div class="text-center">

                            <p>Once we came to an agreement on the designs, I built out high-fidelity versions of each
                                page along with what would happen when users would interact with certain elements
                                (hovering, clicking on a button, etc.). This was completed in Figma. The developers then
                                built the app front end based on the comps I’d created.</p>

                                        team:</span> Because I worked
                                    closely with Scott and John, it was imperative that what I created aligned with
                                    their vision of the web app functionality. Though it’s important to test with
                                    external stakeholders, receiving input from team members was just as necessary.</li>
                                <li><span class="highlight"> Make sure the focus is on the person, not the design:</span>
                                    Since my work was primarily on the UI of the app, it was easy to get lost in the details rather than view the
                                    project at a holistic level. To mitigate this, I would frequently revisit
                                    LeadSigma’s vision. Asking questions like “What is the salesperson trying to achieve
                                    when placed in [X] situation?” or “What functionalities would be important to
                                    highlight on this page?” were important in helping me zoom out and not get stuck on
                                    my design preferences.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>I had a wonderful remote internship experience at LeadSigma. I am so grateful for the
                                opportunity to work on an app that has the true ability to transform the way small
                                businesses operate. Despite being remote, our team built strong relationships during our
                                impromptu and scheduled Google Meets. A special thanks to my teammates and mentors for
                                encouraging my personal and professional growth!</p>
