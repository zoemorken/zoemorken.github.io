                                During the Spring 2021 semester, my team worked with Avanade on a project as part of our Experience Studio course at Purdue University. <span class="highlight">We were tasked to create a digital platform to serve as a source of authoritative guidance for the city of West Lafayette.

                            <p>The two main stakeholders we focused on for the majority of the project were students at Purdue and nurse case managers. Though our solution is geared toward helping students navigate quarantine smoothly, it was important to take into account the needs and goals of case managers so that Protect Purdue could improve its operations as a whole. Goals and frustrations for each were primarily informed by our interview findings.</p>

                            <p>We began our project by attempting to identify a specific user group within the Purdue student body. Though we had decided to focus on COVID-19 confusion at Purdue University, we believed that narrowing in on a distinct population (whether that be related to living situation, class standing, etc.) would be beneficial in coming up with a solution that addressed their specific needs. Before deciding on a group, we first wanted to understand the true breadth of problems students face due to COVID. In doing so, our goal was <span class="highlight">to have a grasp on what issues exist on campus before narrowing our focus.</span></p>

                            <p>We began our research with a survey to send out to the general student population. The goal of using a survey was to identify patterns in problems that various student groups across campus face. Respondents that were interested in participating in a follow-up interview were contacted to share more about their personal experiences or anecdotes regarding COVID-related issues at Purdue.</p>
                            <p>We created our survey using Qualtrics and sent it out to various group chats, Discord servers, and the Purdue subreddit. After leaving it open for one week, our team received a total of 146 responses. Some questions that yielded interesting insights were:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>How safe do you feel at Purdue in regards to COVID-19?</li>
                                <li>Do you feel like Purdue’s guidelines have been effective in protecting the school?</li>
                                <li>Have you experienced any confusion about the COVID-19 protocol while at Purdue?</li>

                                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Most students experience confusion on when to quarantine due to second or third hand exposure.</span> Since there is no clear-cut definition of second or third hand exposure, students are unsure which category they fall into and what steps to take next.</li>
                                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Protect Purdue fails to adequately update students on policy changes.</span> Protect Purdue tries to update students through emails or website updates, but this does not motivate students to read policy changes in depth.</li>
                                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Students don’t know specific regulations for different social settings (e.g. dining courts, dorm rooms, private study rooms, etc.).</span> Students are confused on which guidelines apply in different settings and if there are exceptions.</li>
                                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">There is no direct correlation between where students are living on campus, and their general confusion with the Protect Purdue guidelines.</span> Regardless of their living situation, students were confused on the same issues.</li>

                            <p>Based on our survey findings, we were surprised to discover that <span class="highlight">there was no correlation between a student’s living arrangement and the type of confusion they experience with Protect Purdue guidelines and procedures.</span> Our follow-up interviews demonstrated that there were many opportunities for improvement within the quarantine and isolation process, the greatest being students didn’t know when to quarantine. Because of this, we decided to investigate the process of quarantining at Purdue.</p>
