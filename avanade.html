                            <p>The two main stakeholders we focused on for the majority of the project were students at Purdue and nurse case managers. Though our solution is geared toward helping students navigate quarantine smoothly, it was important to take into account the needs and goals of case managers so that Protect Purdue could improve its operations as a whole. Goals and frustrations for each were primarily informed by our interview findings.</p>

                            <p>We began our project by attempting to identify a specific user group within the Purdue student body. Though we had decided to focus on COVID-19 confusion at Purdue University, we believed that narrowing in on a distinct population (whether that be related to living situation, class standing, etc.) would be beneficial in coming up with a solution that addressed their specific needs. Before deciding on a group, we first wanted to understand the true breadth of problems students face due to COVID. In doing so, our goal was <span class="highlight">to have a grasp on what issues exist on campus before narrowing our focus.</span></p>

                            <p>We began our research with a survey to send out to the general student population. The goal of using a survey was to identify patterns in problems that various student groups across campus face. Respondents that were interested in participating in a follow-up interview were contacted to share more about their personal experiences or anecdotes regarding COVID-related issues at Purdue.</p>
                            <p>We created our survey using Qualtrics and sent it out to various group chats, Discord servers, and the Purdue subreddit. After leaving it open for one week, our team received a total of 146 responses. Some questions that yielded interesting insights were:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>How safe do you feel at Purdue in regards to COVID-19?</li>
                                <li>Do you feel like Purdue’s guidelines have been effective in protecting the school?</li>
                                <li>Have you experienced any confusion about the COVID-19 protocol while at Purdue?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <div class="font-weight-bold my-3">Findings:</div>

                                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Most students experience confusion on when to quarantine due to second or third hand exposure.</span> Since there is no clear-cut definition of second or third hand exposure, students are unsure which category they fall into and what steps to take next.</li>
                                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Protect Purdue fails to adequately update students on policy changes.</span> Protect Purdue tries to update students through emails or website updates, but this does not motivate students to read policy changes in depth.</li>
                                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Students don’t know specific regulations for different social settings (e.g. dining courts, dorm rooms, private study rooms, etc.).</span> Students are confused on which guidelines apply in different settings and if there are exceptions.</li>
                                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">There is no direct correlation between where students are living on campus, and their general confusion with the Protect Purdue guidelines.</span> Regardless of their living situation, students were confused on the same issues.</li>

                            <p>Based on our survey findings, we were surprised to discover that <span class="highlight">there was no correlation between a student’s living arrangement and the type of confusion they experience with Protect Purdue guidelines and procedures.</span> Our follow-up interviews demonstrated that there were many opportunities for improvement within the quarantine and isolation process, the greatest being students didn’t know when to quarantine. Because of this, we decided to investigate the process of quarantining at Purdue.</p>
                            <p>With a general direction to follow, our team wanted to further understand what the quarantine process at Purdue University looks like. We decided to conduct interviews with the Purdue student body in order to get a better picture of the firsthand experience of going through quarantine. Following this, we conducted interviews with members of the Protect Purdue Implementation Team to get the perspective of the people making decisions on behalf of the university. <span class="highlight">By comparing these experiences with those of students, we aimed to pinpoint areas of disconnect between students and staff.</span></p>

                              <figcaption>A forum where students could publicly or anonymously post questions for other students or Protect Purdue staff to answer. Case managers would be able to mark student answers as approved. Additional resources made available to students would include a general schedule of quarantine and isolation, contact information for case managers / fire department, a packing list, meal schedule, and the ability to request somebody to check up on the student.</figcaption>

                            <p>With these sketches completed, we moved forward with concept testing <span class="highlight">to see if our solution would prove useful for students going through quarantine.</span> Our goal for testing with sketches was to be able to make iterations earlier in the process and minimize mistakes in the experience when creating higher fidelity mockups.</p>
                            <div class="font-weight-bold my-3">Findings:</div>
                            <ul>
                                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Participants liked seeing a progress bar but would prefer days left instead of percentage of how much quarantine they completed.</span></li>
                                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Most believed that the live chat would help reduce the amount of phone calls Protect Purdue has to handle.</span></li>
                                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">The packing list should be more prominently displayed.</span> Participants stressed the need for a packing list, as there were items they wished they brought with them when moving into temporary housing.</li>
                                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Most participants did not find the forum useful.</span> Testers believed that students would not make use of it. Additionally, they explained if they had an option to talk to a case manager, they would rather just message their case manager through the live chat.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>With our first round of concept testing completed, we removed the forum. Most importantly, <span class="highlight">we were able to verify our design being something students in Purdue Village could actually see themselves using.</span></p>

                            <p>We conducted a second round of concept testing to ensure our design was still useful to students, especially since the design was higher in fidelity and the forum was removed.</p>

                                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">The live chat was something students wished they had in quarantine.</span> One participant noted that having a written form of communication was better so that they could refer back to past conversations if needed.</li>

                            <p>If we were to continue our project, we would continue building out high-fidelity mockups based on our feedback. Another possibility would be to conduct usability testing to ensure the layout of the solution is easy to understand. As always, more research would ensure that our design meets the evolving needs of students as much as possible. Some ideas include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Making an interactive Minimum Viable Product (MVP).</span>An interactive MVP would allow testers and users to clearly see how our design could be incorporated into their experience.</li>
                                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Conducting contextual inquiry research.</span> If it wasn’t risky, our team could conduct contextual inquiries by going to Purdue Village and interviewing individuals currently in quarantine. We would be able to learn firsthand what the experience looks like while students are currently in quarantine.
                                </li>
                                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Doing a diary study.</span> A diary study is a method that is “used to collect qualitative data about user behaviors, activities, and experiences over time. In a diary study, data is self-reported by participants longitudinally” (Salazar, 2016). Considering that students are in temporary housing for two weeks, we could ask students coming in whether they would like to opt into a study documenting their activities and feelings.</li>
                                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Interview students in a wide variety of majors, especially those who frequently go to class in person.</span> Students with in-person classes could have an entirely different issue / perspective we could design for.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>From this testing we decided to reorganize the resources page to incorporate a hierarchy of the most to least used resources.</p>

We also developed a better appreciation for research thanks to how research-intensive this project was. Though we were unable to reach higher fidelity work, our team gathered a lot of invaluable research and testing in order to make the UI a solo project that will allow for individual practice.</p>
