        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <div class="context">
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>During the Spring 2020 semester, our Experience Studio team at Purdue University was sponsored by
                DonateEquity, a consultancy and digital data company providing information on high value business owners
                to non-profits seeking donations. This was an open-ended project that allowed us to explore many
                possible avenues toward a solution.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="overview">
            <div class="objective">
                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>With the rise of digital information available on the Internet, there is potential for non-profits
                    (universities in particular) to seek out and solicit new leads for donations. Data integration and
                    machine learning enable a new level of valuable data mining, in which non-profits could leverage to
                    find affinities with potential donors. Therefore, we were encouraged to create a solution that would
                    help universities identify prominent businesspeople through their existing alumni network that could
                    give the university a donation of sizable monetary value.</p>
                <p>Though there were many different directions we could take this project, we eventually shifted our
                    focus towards
                    <span style="background-color: #fff2cc">university development officers needing a way to better
                        connect with donors on their portfolio</span>. From our interviews, we found that many officers
                    were not satisfied with their university's chosen CRM tool, as it did not allow for the flexibility
                    needed during business trips. This was an area of improvement we identified to help officers develop
                    more personal relationships despite needing to do so with a large number of donors. As will be
                    discussed later, the shift was warranted by a completely different problem that revealed itself
                    during interviews.</p>

            <h1>Design Process</h1>
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>For this project, we completed a series of four design sprints, each lasting two weeks. We originally
                intended to go through the process of user research, sketching, prototyping/building low-fidelity and
                high-fidelity mockups, and testing in a condensed period of time. However, because we rescoped, we
                revised our timeline and used each sprint instead to better understand our new focus: making
                meaningful and lasting connections with current donors. In doing so, our project was focused on
                recreating Affinity’s concept rather than building out its user interface (UI).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="datacollection">
            <h1>Sprint 1</h1>
            <h2>Secondary Research</h2>
            <p>This sprint was made up of a combination of activities, which can be categorized into research and
                ideation. Our goals were to familiarize ourselves with how universities acquire donations, determine
                existing tools universities use to discover new leads, and sketch out ideas for Affinity’s interface.

                    <h3>Research</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Goal – to understand more about university advancement and the different business terms
                            involved in
                            acquiring donations.</li>
                        <li>Overview – individually researched a breadth of topics (e.g., what motivates the act of
                            donating, how
                            schools build their alumni network, etc.), then put our findings in an affinity diagram to
                            share what we discovered and determine what we still wanted to know.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="surveyresults-right">
                    <h3>Ideation</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Goal – to gain inspiration from existing customer relationship management (CRM) tools used
                            by universities to keep track of donors by recording likes, dislikes, and questions about
                            each.</li>
                        <li>Overview – individually picked a popular CRM to investigate, then held a gallery walk to
                            explore the CRMs chosen.</li>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>One of the major takeaways that we had from the information gathered during this sprint was that we
                had assumed alumni centers were responsible for dealing with acquiring donations. Our assumption
                was proved false from the interviews we conducted during this sprint . In reality, most universities
                have a distinct separation between their alumni engagement office and their development center. The
                alumni
                center hosts events for alumni while the development office deals with all donations and philanthropic
                activities.This realization has presented a new area of opportunity for us to consider when developing a
                solution.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="dataanalysis">
            <h1>Sprint 2</h1>
            <h2>Interviews</h2>
            <p>The main focus of this sprint was to conduct research with our newly-identified user group:
                development officers at universities. From the first sprint, we learned that most universities have two,
                separate offices for alumni engagement and university development.</p>
            <p>To clarify, an alumni association deals with getting alumni involved with a school’s activities
                (e.g., inviting them to programs, services, and events, connecting alumni through clubs and networks,
                providing opportunities for both career and personal growth, etc.) while a development office focuses
                on securing donations and promoting philanthropic activity. Because we did not recognize this
                distinction of departments earlier, we revised our plan for this sprint to talk to those working at
                university
                development offices, as the interviews we did up until this point were with faculty at alumni
                associations.</p>
            <p>In doing so, our goal was to find saturation in our results – researching and doing as many interviews
                as necessary to see what development officers pinpoint as an issue – and determine whether Affinity as
                a tool to discover new leads would be something officers would find useful.</p>
            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>Over the course of this sprint we conducted a total of eight in-person and online interviews. Three of
                these were in-person interviews with officers working at Purdue and the other five were from various
                colleges conducted over phone video call. Interviews were carried out through the course of this sprint
                in teams of two, with one person leading the interview and one person recording notes. Most of the
                interviews lasted from 30 minutes – 1 hour.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Identifying prospects and reaching out to major gift
                            donors.</span> With all alumni recorded in a university’s CRM, development officers have
                        large pool of people to reach out to. In addition to the CRM, officers use resources from
                        fundraising consultancies or do a Google search to view a donor’s LinkedIn.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Maintaining a portfolio and contact report of prospective
                            donors.</span> Each development officer has their own way of managing their portfolio.
                        Though all are required to log contact reports into the university’s CRM, some officers have
                        a separate way of organizing personal notes on donors (e.g., spreadsheet, writing email
                        drafts to oneself, etc.).</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting KPIs for long-term strategic planning.</span> Since
                        it can take up to five years for a donor to complete one round in the development cycle,
                        KPIs are based on factors such as how many people discovered, how many donations
                        solicited/pledged, etc.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Maintaining meaningful and lasting relationships.</span>
                        Officers are able to form long-lasting relationships with their donors by practicing
                        relationship-building techniques, such as remembering details from their last conversation,
                        sending them articles about the university they might be interested in, or bringing gifts
                        during their in-person meetings.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Our major takeaway from this sprint was that development officers aren’t necessarily concerned
                    with
                    discovering new leads. With their university’s CRM, plenty of online tools, and social media
                    (e.g.,
                    LinkedIn) to look through, finding prospective donors is not a difficult task. <span
                        style="background-color: #fff2cc">Instead, we found that
                        fostering relationships and building trust with current donors was more important.</span>
                    Since officers represent the university, much of their work is dedicated toward in-person visits
                    with donors.</p>

                “What medicine I should take?” “How serious is this?” and “What I can do to recover?.” We summed them up into
                two major questions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>What's wrong with me?</li>

            <h1>Sprint 3</h1>
            <h2>Redefined Scope and Sketching</h2>
            <p>After each interview revealed to us the complexity involved in maintaining relationships with donors,
                we knew we had to redefine our problem scope. Originally, our problem statement was “to find and reach
                out to donors not previously on a development officer’s radar.” <span style="background-color: #fff2cc">Due to the significance the officers placed on strengthening their already-existing connections, we realigned our problem scope to focus on managing these personal connections through emphasis on details obtained from in-person
                interactions.</span></p>
            <h2>Spreadsheet</h2>
            <p>Before jumping straight into ideation, our sponsor encouraged us to pinpoint ideas by summarizing interview findings to identify potential issues. Following this, we created a list to prioritize certain ideas over others based on how frequently they were brought up by several interviewees, then proceeded to sketch on ideas that topped the list.</p>

            <h2>Low-Fidelity Concept Sketches</h2>
            <p>After consolidating our ideas into the spreadsheet, we then prioritized the top two areas of focus we wanted to addrress in our solution: (1) creation and management of contact reports, and (2) map function to search donor location. Each team member then made several sketches on the features decided upon. After explaining our ideas to each other, we noted similarities between them and chose sketches we could use to base Affinity’s homepage on.

            </div>
            <h2>Problem Statement and Elevator Pitch</h2>
            <p>From the many interviews we conducted, we learned the importance of development officers keeping in
                close communication with their donors in order to successfully solicit a donation. This was the basis for
                our new problem statement:</p>
            <h4>In order to successfully acquire large donations for a university, development officers must <span style="font-weight: bold">build lasting
                relationships and foster trust with their donors in their portfolio through consistent and close
                communication.</span> This is done through their in-person visits.</h4>
            <p>From this, we developed our elevator pitch. Since Affinity was to be a new product, an elevator pitch
                was necessary in order to describe its use and importance:</p>
            <h4>For University Major Gifts / Development Officers who need a way to easily access and record important
                information about their donors, <span style="font-weight: bold">Affinity is a cloud-based, database tool integrated with the
                university’s CRM that allows for efficient creation and retrieval of contact reports as well as
                flexible meeting scheduling.</span></h4>

        <div class="testing">
            <h1>Sprint 4</h1>
            <h2>Concept Design and Testing</h2>
            <p>In Sprint 3, we redefined our scope and narrowed down to one central idea. Our focus for this sprint,
                therefore, was to build out Affinity’s concept through wireframes and conduct testing.</p>
            <h2>Persona</h2>
            <p>The goal of creating a persona was to put a face to the development officer and help an external audience understand Affinity in context.</p>
            <div class="persona">
                <!-- <img src="images/katherine.png" alt="Our Persona, Katherin."> -->
                <div class="persona-right">
                    <h3>Katherine</h3>
                    <p>Katherine Hensley is a senior development officer at the University of
                        Michigan. Her role as a development officer is to meet and
                        communicate with alumni and friends of the college in order to solicit
                        five- or six-figure gift donations. Before requesting a donation, she
                        must build meaningful, long-term relationships with donors and
                        prospects as well as work with them to determine what their
                        donation should go towards. Since donors are spread out across the
                        world, her job requires frequent travel.</p>

          <h2>Wireframes</h2>  
          <p>To flesh out our idea of Affinity, including the two primary functions (contact report creation and retrieval
            and scheduling) and secondary functionalities, such as viewing a development officer’s portfolio, pulling
            information from the university’s CRM, and sharing an itinerary with others.</p>
            <p>Before fleshing out wireframes and designs, we had to decide what the flow of our application would be
                like. For this, we created a site flow on Whimsical that included the main pages, lead off pages and
                features, as well as additional independent pages. Once this was done, we determined how the different
                features would lead into other pages.</p>

            <h1>Next Steps</h1>
            <p>If we were to continue this project, we would investigate the inner workings of the development office.
                Though Affinity is created for development officers, it would be interesting to test how different types of
                officers would use our app. As we found from research, a regular officer’s goal may be to discover new
                prospects while a director might be more concerned with managing officers/continuing interaction with
                high-profile alumni. Conducting more interviews and gaining more knowledge on the development office
                could help us tailor Affinity to a specific officer within the hierarchy.</p>
            <p>Another way would further this project would be to better understand the relationship between an
                alumni engagement office and development office. Since the two have an overlapping user base (the
                majority of donors tend to be alumni), it would be fascinating to identify ways we could leverage the two
                to maximize the size of donations universities receive.</p>
                <p>To conclude, this project was challenging yet rewarding. Our project was initially very structured, which
                    then transitioned to exploratory as we rescoped. Because of this, we were able to gain experience with
                    conducting extensive research and truly empathize with our user group. This semester, our team
                    earned how to readily adapt to both project-related and personal changes. We are proud of the work
                    we have done, but more so on how much we have grown throughout it all.</p>
