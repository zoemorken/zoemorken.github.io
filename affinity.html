        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <div class="context">
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>During the Spring 2020 semester, our Experience Studio team at Purdue University was sponsored by DonateEquity, a consultancy and digital data company providing information on high value business owners to non-profits seeking donations. This was an open-ended project that allowed us to explore many possible avenues toward a solution.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="overview">
            <div class="objective">
                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>With the rise of digital information available on the Internet, there is potential for non-profits (universities in particular) to seek out and solicit new leads for donations. Data integration and machine learning enable a new level of valuable data mining, in which non-profits could leverage to find affinities with potential donors. Therefore, we were encouraged to create a solution that would help universities identify prominent businesspeople through their existing alumni network that could give the university a donation of sizable monetary value.</p>
                <p>Though there were many different directions we could take this project, we eventually shifted our focus towards
                    <span style="background-color: #fff2cc">university development officers needing a way to better connect with donors on their portfolio</span>. From our interviews, we found that many officers were not satisfied with their university's chosen CRM tool, as it did not allow for the flexibility needed during business trips. This was an area of improvement we identified to help officers develop more personal relationships despite needing to do so with a large number of donors. As will be discussed later, the shift was warranted by a completely different problem that revealed itself during interviews.</p>

            <h1>Design Process</h1>
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>For this project, we completed a series of four design sprints, each lasting two weeks. We originally
                intended to go through the process of user research, sketching, prototyping/building low-fidelity and
                high-fidelity mockups, and testing in a condensed period of time. However, because we rescoped, we
                revised our timeline and used each sprint instead to better understand our new focus: making
                meaningful and lasting connections with current donors. In doing so, our project was focused on
                recreating Affinity’s concept rather than building out its user interface (UI).</p>
            <p>We looked into three different problems in healthcare regarding the following categories, eventually deciding to look into gaps within the healthcare transition process.</p>
            <p>We noticed that college students were the user group most likely to not communicate with healthcare providers on a regular basis. Narrowing further, we looked into the theme of healthcare transition. This is defined as <span style="background-color: #fff2cc">the process of taking care of one's own health-related information and activity</span>.</p>
            <p>With the general scope of “healthcare transition,” we gradually modified our scope based on pain
                points discovered through a survey study and expert interview.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Encourage college students to ask more questions.</li>
                <li>Help college students onboard into their school's healthcare system.</li>
                <li>Better inform college students on what action to take.</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>Data Collection</h1>
            <h2>Survey</h2>
            <p>Our goal in sending out a survey was to get a better understanding of <span style="background-color: #fff2cc">students’ knowledge on healthcare before, during, and after their transition to college</span> (including insurance, medical records, medical history, etc.).</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>In the survey, we asked our participants to rate themselves on how knowledgeable they are about their medical insurance on a 1 to 5 scale (1 being not knowledgeable and 5 being knowledgeable). The result average was 2.29.</p>

                    <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                    <p>We confirmed that not understanding how to seek help from the healthcare system is a problem among college students. More importantly, what makes this issue more severe is that college students don’t recognize it as a problem.</p>

            <h2>Purdue University Student Health Center (PUSH) Interview</h2>
            <p>To gain more perspective from the provider side of patient–provider communication, we interviewed Gwen Richardson, a nurse practitioner at PUSH. Our interviewee was able to give us a baseline understanding of the inner workings of PUSH and what she feels are barriers when communicating with students.</p>
            <p>The interview was more conversation-like, where two team members of our group started from our standard provider interview protocol and inserted follow-up questions when necessary. It was carried out on October 10, 2019 at PUSH within a 30-minute interval.</p>
            <h3>Interview Takeaways</h3>
            <div class="interviewtakeaways">
                <ol>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cost is important to students.</span> Both our interviewee and PUSH strive to be honest and upfront about how much an appointment or visitation will cost a student. This is done to prevent surprise bills and claims that students were not informed.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Students lack proper healthcare knowledge.</span> Richardson mentions that many of the students that come in are unfamiliar with their health insurance. Some students come in not knowing what medication they’re taking (if they are taking medication) or why. Because of this, providers must either search through a student’s medical record for a past diagnosis or contact the patient’s primary doctor.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Students under-utilize their PUSH patient portal.</span> Each Purdue student automatically has an account, and though providers encourage communication through this channel, students still have not readily adopted this tool. Some students, upon receiving a secure message notification in their email, think that the message is spam or forget about it entirely.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Since students are unprepared in handling their own healthcare information and activity, they do not speak up even if they may have questions or concerns.</span> This is a pain point for Richardson, as she wants all students to know that PUSH is a safe place where information is confidential. In a university setting, students should feel comfortable sharing health-related concerns and asking questions to help practitioners better understand their situations.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>When comparing Richardson’s viewpoints with those of the patients we interviewed, their is an evident difference in mindset leading to a disconnect in straightforward communication. Out of these insights, we found the lack of interaction with the online portal interesting, since it was a technology-forward solution which the younger generation was rejecting. Therefore, our ideation revolved around what we could build off of this existing technology.</p>

            <h2>Persona</h2>
            <p>From collected data, we created a persona to help align our ideas and direct our Experience Map.</p>
            <div class="persona">

            <h2>Experience Map</h2>
            <p>Taking our persona as an inspiration, we decided to create an experience map to show different scenarios students might go through while they are here on campus and need to use PUSH’s services. We focused on five different phases which were pre-college, vaccine, getting sick, getting a severe disease, and post-college.</p>

            <p>What informed us on this map were the questions and concerns during the early stage of getting sick, such as “What medicine I should take?” “How serious is this?” and “What I can do to recover?.” We summed them up into two major questions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>What's wrong with me?</li>
                <li>What should I do?</li>

            <h1>Ideation</h1>
            <h2>Sketching</h2>
            <p>After doing research to figure out more about our target group and see specifically where the main pain points were, we started ideation. Our more prominent ideas were a medical checklist, medical questionnaire, and PUSH patient portal onboarding.</p>

            <h2>Whiteboarding</h2>
            <p>With these three general directions in mind – medical checklist, medical questionnaire, and PUSH patient portal onboarding – we attempted to probe deeper into how Mia would interact if given one of these solutions. The results were negative; because these designs were all very one-sided in terms of interaction, we found that Mia would lose interest in all situations because there was no direct communication element with a provider. Furthermore, the medical checklist and PUSH onboarding solutions were more of a one-time point of contact that did not promote continued usage over our user group’s transition period.</p>
            <p>Because of these reasons, we scrapped our ideas and scrutinized the “getting sick” phase of our Experience Map. We ideated again separately, our goal being to break down communication barriers between college patients and providers, and came back together to whiteboard as a group. In doing so, our ideas aligned much better. </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Our idea:</span> A tool implemented into the current PUSH portal that would help students determine whether they should schedule an appointment with PUSH. We felt that this addressed our scope because instead of having students worry about their illness by reading online sources – an insight we found from our Experience Map – we would have them initiate the interaction with PUSH from the beginning so that PUSH may assist them through sickness and into recovery.</p>

            <h2>Figma Prototype</h2>
            <p>The goal of testing our Figma wireframes was to gauge people’s understanding and preconceived notions of “wizards” as well as determine whether these solutions would be adopted by our user group.</p>

            <h1>Next Steps</h1>
            <p>We had other ideas we would like to explore further for the purposes of this project.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Journaling:</span> Users would have the option to write down their own thoughts and feelings about their illness when using the tool. From testing, we found that the multiple choice questions could be hindering accurate diagnosis.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold">History:</span> The patient and medical practitioner should also be able to see previous use results of the diagnosis tool. </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Driving Tool Usage:</span> Another topic brought up during our meetings was how the diagnosis tool should be introduced. We had ideas on introducing the portal through word of mouth, during PUSH appointments, or through the PUSH website.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Summary and Design Rationale</h1>
            <p>This diagnosis tool implemented into PUSH’s patient portal is meant for students to make the first
                steps toward taking care of their health. Our solution encourages enhances patient-provider
                communication by first getting students comfortable using the portal, then scheduling an appointment
                when necessary.</p>
            <p>Instead of leaving students at a loss of what to do when they get sick, we hoped that our solution
                would fuel their desire to be more aware of how to take care of themselves during a major transition
                period (home to college) in their lives.</p>
            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>Open-ended projects such as this require much careful research and planning. Though we were focused on scoping down as soon as possible, our haste ironically led us to wander around the problem space in circles.</p>
            <p>After choosing a scope and sticking to it, most of our research was fairly traditional (secondary research, surveys, interviews). If planned better, our group would have hosted a co-design workshop to provide more deeper insights.</p>
            <p>Though we experienced setbacks, our group was able to successfully pull together a solution that addressed a real need in our community.</p>
