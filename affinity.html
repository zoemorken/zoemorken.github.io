                  During the Spring 2020 semester, my team worked with
                  DonateEquity on a project as part of our Experience Studio
                  course at Purdue University. <span class="highlight">We were initially tasked to
                  create a tool that would enable university fundraising
                  officers to quickly identify potential donors to solicit major
                  gifts from. Our research findings led us to shift our focus
                  instead towards helping officers build close and lasting
                  relationships with their regular donors.</span>

                  I co-led a team of seven UX Design students and worked closely

                  conducting interviews, synthesizing findings from
                  stakeholders, and designing the wireframes for our finalized
                  concept.</span> As a team lead, I mentored and delegated tasks to
                  first-year students throughout the course of the semester as

                    Katherine is a senior development officer at the University
                    of Michigan. Her job involves traveling and meeting with
                    alumni and friends of the university in order to solicit
                    major gift donations. Before requesting a donation, however,
                    she must cultivate meaningful, long-term relationships with
                    donors and prospects.

                  Katherine struggles to efficiently navigate and input
                  information into the mobile CRM app when she’s constantly on
                  the move during business trips. Additionally, with a tight
                  schedule, she also finds it difficult to fit in time for
                  impromptu meetings with donors.

                <p>
                  To begin, our team conducted several interviews with
                  administrators from various university alumni associations.
                  Initially, we were under the impression that alumni officers
                  were the ones soliciting donations. We soon learned that many
                  universities have two, separate offices for alumni engagement
                  and university development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From this realization we then conducted eight interviews with
                  development officers, three of which were in-person interviews
                  with officers working at Purdue. Our goal was to understand
                  the role of a development officer and find pain points areas
                  where their workflows could be improved.

                  After our interviews, we identified the common themes we heard
                  from our participants. <span class="highlight">Our most significant and unexpected
                  takeaway was that development officers do not have a problem
                  finding new leads / prospects with their existing resources
                  (internet and university archives). Instead, we found that
                  fostering relationships and building trust with current donors
                  was more important.</span> Since officers represent the university,
                  much of their work is dedicated toward in-person visits with
                  donors. This led us to realign our problem scope to focus on
                  managing these interpersonal connections through emphasis on
                  details obtained from in-person interactions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition to interviews, we engaged in other research
                  methods. These included examining online resources, analyzing
                  findings through multiple affinity diagrams, and reviewing
                  existing solutions for development officers (mainly CRMs). The
                  activities were done concurrently with our interviews and
                  helped us have productive conversations with our participants.

                  Note: Because of the current COVID-19 pandemic and the shift
                  to remote work during this sprint, all of our communication
                  between our team as well as our sponsor moved to Zoom and
                  Slack. Owing to these challenges, we made do by communicating
                  with our interviewees over email. This was limiting, but still
                  managed to provide us enough details to plan our next steps
                  accordingly.

                <p>
                  Before making this pivot in our project, we created a
                  spreadsheet to reflect what we had learned from our
                  interviews. Each team member reviewed one interview’s audio
                  recording and written notes. In the spreadsheet, we wrote out
                  each interviewee’s pain points, current solutions, and ideas
                  to address said pain points.

                  In the end, we decided that our solution would be in the form
                  of a mobile application integrated with the university’s CRM.
                  Because development officers are not always in a position to
                  pull out their laptop and write down notes after each donor
                  meeting, we saw value in convenience. The two main features we
                  prioritized were:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <span class="highlight fast">Contact report drafting and organization</span> – an easily
                    scannable list of previous trips an officer has taken
                    (sorted from most recent to least recent), along with their
                    respective reports on each of the donors visited.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="highlight fast">Donor tracker</span> – a map depicting the number of donors in a
                    development officer’s portfolio residing in a particular
                    area. The larger the amount of donors living in one city,
                    the bigger the representation on the map. This was done in
                    order to assist officers in seeing who else they could meet
                    up with in an area.
                  </li>
                </ol>

                  A site map was created for the purpose of communicating the
                  different functions we wanted to prioritize within the mobile
                  experience for our stakeholders. Since we were paring down the
                  CRM to include only those features interacted with during
                  business trips, we organized the flow by primary versus
                  secondary screens.
                </p>

                  In order to better understand if officers would find this app
                  useful for their responsibilities at work as well as evaluate
                  the overall concept, we conducted usability testing through
                  screen sharing on video calls. Unfortunately, our current
                  situation could not allow us to truly simulate their work
                  environment but the feedback we received informed our
                  iterations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For testing, we followed up with several of our interviewees
                  from earlier and used an unstructured approach in which we
                  gave them control of our screen to explore the prototypes.
                  First, we had them think back to their last trip visiting
                  donors and use their experience to guide their understanding
                  of our solution. Then we had participants view a set of
                  screens and explain to us their initial perceptions of the
                  tool in the context of their own experience.
                </p>
                <h5 id="findings">

                  <li>
                    In a donor profile, they would like to see the donor’s
                    preferred mode of communication, what date the last gift was
                    given, and the city a donor is from to help with
                    organization.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Since donors can move both forwards and backwards in the
                    life cycle, there should be a more dynamic option for
                    selecting what part of the cycle a donor is in.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    It would be useful to see unmanaged donors on the map so
                    that the officer could reach out to someone new if they find
                    themselves in the area.

                  This project was a great learning experience for me. Through
                  it all, I had to master the art of adapting: to my role as a
                  team lead, to the dramatic rescoping of our project, and
                  finally, the transition from in-person to remote
                  collaboration. Despite the challenges, we were able to gain
                  experience with conducting extensive research and truly
                  empathize with our user group.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In terms of future considerations, we would have liked to
                  explore the relationship between a university’s alumni
                  engagement office and development office. Since the two have
                  an overlapping user base (as the majority of donors tend to be
                  alumni), it would be fascinating to identify ways we could
                  leverage the two to maximize the size of donations
                  universities receive. While we didn’t pursue this area of
                  focus due to time constraints, we made sure that our sponsor
                  was aware of the different possibilities Affinity could take
                  in the future.

                  Update: In light of COVID-19, this project has returned to our
                  Experience Studio course in order to be adapted for university
                  development officers as they fulfill their responsibilities
                  remotely. I was the Project Owner for the Fall 2020 team
                  working on Affinity and supervised them throughout
                  the semester.
