        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <div class="context">
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>During the Spring 2020 semester, our Experience Studio team at Purdue University was sponsored by
                DonateEquity, a consultancy and digital data company providing information on high value business owners
                to non-profits seeking donations. This was an open-ended project that allowed us to explore many
                possible avenues toward a solution.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="overview">
            <div class="objective">
                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>With the rise of digital information available on the Internet, there is potential for non-profits
                    (universities in particular) to seek out and solicit new leads for donations. Data integration and
                    machine learning enable a new level of valuable data mining, in which non-profits could leverage to
                    find affinities with potential donors. Therefore, we were encouraged to create a solution that would
                    help universities identify prominent businesspeople through their existing alumni network that could
                    give the university a donation of sizable monetary value.</p>
                <p>Though there were many different directions we could take this project, we eventually shifted our
                    focus towards
                    <span style="background-color: #fff2cc">university development officers needing a way to better
                        connect with donors on their portfolio</span>. From our interviews, we found that many officers
                    were not satisfied with their university's chosen CRM tool, as it did not allow for the flexibility
                    needed during business trips. This was an area of improvement we identified to help officers develop
                    more personal relationships despite needing to do so with a large number of donors. As will be
                    discussed later, the shift was warranted by a completely different problem that revealed itself
                    during interviews.</p>

            <h1>Design Process</h1>
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>For this project, we completed a series of four design sprints, each lasting two weeks. We originally
                intended to go through the process of user research, sketching, prototyping/building low-fidelity and
                high-fidelity mockups, and testing in a condensed period of time. However, because we rescoped, we
                revised our timeline and used each sprint instead to better understand our new focus: making
                meaningful and lasting connections with current donors. In doing so, our project was focused on
                recreating Affinity’s concept rather than building out its user interface (UI).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="datacollection">
            <h1>Sprint 1</h1>
            <h2>Secondary Research</h2>
            <p>This sprint was made up of a combination of activities, which can be categorized into research and
                ideation. Our goals were to familiarize ourselves with how universities acquire donations, determine
                existing tools universities use to discover new leads, and sketch out ideas for Affinity’s interface.

                    <h3>Research</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Goal – to understand more about university advancement and the different business terms
                            involved in
                            acquiring donations.</li>
                        <li>Overview – individually researched a breadth of topics (e.g., what motivates the act of
                            donating, how
                            schools build their alumni network, etc.), then put our findings in an affinity diagram to
                            share what we discovered and determine what we still wanted to know.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="surveyresults-right">
                    <h3>Ideation</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Goal – to gain inspiration from existing customer relationship management (CRM) tools used
                            by universities to keep track of donors by recording likes, dislikes, and questions about
                            each.</li>
                        <li>Overview – individually picked a popular CRM to investigate, then held a gallery walk to
                            explore the CRMs chosen.</li>

            </div>
            <p>One of the major takeaways that we had from the information gathered during this sprint was that we
                had assumed alumni centers were responsible for dealing with acquiring donations. Our assumption
                was proved false from the interviews we conducted during this sprint . In reality, most universities
                have a distinct separation between their alumni engagement office and their development center. The
                alumni
                center hosts events for alumni while the development office deals with all donations and philanthropic
                activities.This realization has presented a new area of opportunity for us to consider when developing a
                solution.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="dataanalysis">
            <h1>Sprint 2</h1>
            <h2>Interviews</h2>
            <p>The main focus of this sprint was to conduct research with our newly-identified user group:
                development officers at universities. From the first sprint, we learned that most universities have two,
                separate offices for alumni engagement and university development.</p>
            <p>To clarify, an alumni association deals with getting alumni involved with a school’s activities
                (e.g., inviting them to programs, services, and events, connecting alumni through clubs and networks,
                providing opportunities for both career and personal growth, etc.) while a development office focuses
                on securing donations and promoting philanthropic activity. Because we did not recognize this
                distinction of departments earlier, we revised our plan for this sprint to talk to those working at
                university
                development offices, as the interviews we did up until this point were with faculty at alumni
                associations.</p>
            <p>In doing so, our goal was to find saturation in our results – researching and doing as many interviews
                as necessary to see what development officers pinpoint as an issue – and determine whether Affinity as
                a tool to discover new leads would be something officers would find useful.</p>
            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>Over the course of this sprint we conducted a total of eight in-person and online interviews. Three of
                these were in-person interviews with officers working at Purdue and the other five were from various
                colleges conducted over phone video call. Interviews were carried out through the course of this sprint
                in teams of two, with one person leading the interview and one person recording notes. Most of the
                interviews lasted from 30 minutes – 1 hour.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Identifying prospects and reaching out to major gift
                            donors.</span> With all alumni recorded in a university’s CRM, development officers have
                        large pool of people to reach out to. In addition to the CRM, officers use resources from
                        fundraising consultancies or do a Google search to view a donor’s LinkedIn.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Maintaining a portfolio and contact report of prospective
                            donors.</span> Each development officer has their own way of managing their portfolio.
                        Though all are required to log contact reports into the university’s CRM, some officers have
                        a separate way of organizing personal notes on donors (e.g., spreadsheet, writing email
                        drafts to oneself, etc.).</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting KPIs for long-term strategic planning.</span> Since
                        it can take up to five years for a donor to complete one round in the development cycle,
                        KPIs are based on factors such as how many people discovered, how many donations
                        solicited/pledged, etc.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Maintaining meaningful and lasting relationships.</span>
                        Officers are able to form long-lasting relationships with their donors by practicing
                        relationship-building techniques, such as remembering details from their last conversation,
                        sending them articles about the university they might be interested in, or bringing gifts
                        during their in-person meetings.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Our major takeaway from this sprint was that development officers aren’t necessarily concerned
                    with
                    discovering new leads. With their university’s CRM, plenty of online tools, and social media
                    (e.g.,
                    LinkedIn) to look through, finding prospective donors is not a difficult task. <span
                        style="background-color: #fff2cc">Instead, we found that
                        fostering relationships and building trust with current donors was more important.</span>
                    Since officers represent the university, much of their work is dedicated toward in-person visits
                    with donors.</p>

                “What medicine I should take?” “How serious is this?” and “What I can do to recover?.” We summed them up into
                two major questions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>What's wrong with me?</li>
                <li>What should I do?</li>

            <p>After each interview revealed to us the complexity involved in maintaining relationships with donors,
                we
                knew we had to redefine our problem scope. Originally, our problem statement was “to find and reach
                out to donors not previously on a development officer’s radar.” Due to the significance the officers
                placed on strengthening their already-existing connections, we realigned our problem scope to focus
                on
                managing these personal connections through emphasis on details obtained from in-person
                interactions.</p>

            <h2>Whiteboarding</h2>
            <p>With these three general directions in mind – medical checklist, medical questionnaire, and PUSH
                patient portal
                onboarding – we attempted to probe deeper into how Mia would interact if given one of these
                solutions. The
                results were negative; because these designs were all very one-sided in terms of interaction, we
                found that Mia
                would lose interest in all situations because there was no direct communication element with a
                provider.
                Furthermore, the medical checklist and PUSH onboarding solutions were more of a one-time point of
                contact that
                did not promote continued usage over our user group’s transition period.</p>
            <p>Because of these reasons, we scrapped our ideas and scrutinized the “getting sick” phase of our
                Experience Map.
                We ideated again separately, our goal being to break down communication barriers between college
                patients and
                providers, and came back together to whiteboard as a group. In doing so, our ideas aligned much
                better. </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Our idea:</span> A tool implemented into the current PUSH portal that
                would help
                students determine whether they should schedule an appointment with PUSH. We felt that this
                addressed our scope
                because instead of having students worry about their illness by reading online sources – an insight
                we found
                from our Experience Map – we would have them initiate the interaction with PUSH from the beginning
                so that PUSH
                may assist them through sickness and into recovery.</p>

            <h1>Testing</h1>
            <p>After whiteboarding our final solution, we turned to Figma to create low-fidelity wireframes. These,
                along with paper prototypes, were used for testing whether our design would address our chosen
                scope.</p>
            <h2>Figma Prototype</h2>
            <p>The goal of testing our Figma wireframes was to gauge people’s understanding and preconceived notions
                of
                “wizards” as well as determine whether these solutions would be adopted by our user group.</p>

                <li>Users found that this solution more trustworthy and reliable than searching their symptoms
                    online.</li>
                <li>There was confusion with the layout of the diagnosis page.</li>
                <li>Users wanted a progress bar for the survey to track how their progress.</li>
                <li>Users preferred the term “wizard” over “chatbot.”

            <h2>Concept Testing – Paper Prototype</h2>
            <p>A paper prototype was created in order to determine how best to organize our screen for symptom
                severity (rating
                the level of severity for each symptom that the patient lists).</p>

                <li>Sectioned the timeline to better indicate user progress and the amount of questions that remain.
                </li>
                <li>Added percentages on the diagnoses page to emphasize that tool should be used as a suggestion.
                </li>
                <li>Hid information away on separate tabs for easy access when the user scrolls down.</li>

                    multiple

                <li><span style="font-weight: bold">History:</span> The patient and medical practitioner should also

                <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Driving Tool Usage:</span> Another topic brought up during our
                    meetings was
                    how the diagnosis tool should be introduced. We had ideas on introducing the portal through word
                    of mouth,
                    during PUSH appointments, or through the PUSH website.</li>

            <h1>Summary and Design Rationale</h1>
            <p>This diagnosis tool implemented into PUSH’s patient portal is meant for students to make the first
                steps toward taking care of their health. Our solution encourages enhances patient-provider
                communication by first getting students comfortable using the portal, then scheduling an appointment
                when necessary.</p>
            <p>Instead of leaving students at a loss of what to do when they get sick, we hoped that our solution
                would fuel their desire to be more aware of how to take care of themselves during a major transition
                period (home to college) in their lives.</p>
            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>Open-ended projects such as this require much careful research and planning. Though we were focused
                on scoping
                down as soon as possible, our haste ironically led us to wander around the problem space in circles.
            </p>
            <p>After choosing a scope and sticking to it, most of our research was fairly traditional (secondary
                research,
                surveys, interviews). If planned better, our group would have hosted a co-design workshop to provide
                more deeper
                insights.</p>
            <p>Though we experienced setbacks, our group was able to successfully pull together a solution that
                addressed a real
                need in our community.</p>
