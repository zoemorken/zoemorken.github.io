                                During the Spring 2020 semester, I worked on my capstone project as part of my Learning
                                Studio course at Purdue University. I chose to focus my efforts on redesigning <a
                                    href="https://www.mealtrain.com/" target="_blank">Meal Train</a> to support cancer
                                patients and their caregivers through the treatment process. <span class="highlight">As
                                    the sole UX Designer on this project, I determined primary stakeholder needs and
                                    motivations through various research methods as well as designed an end-to-end
                                    solution that would facilitate trust between those involved.</span>

                            <p>
                                When middle-aged cancer patients are in the recovery phase of treatment, their
                                caregivers (typically a partner, family member, or close friend) often have many
                                responsibilities that can leave them overwhelmed. One of these primary responsibilities
                                is ensuring that the patient is being fed nutrition-dense, healthy food.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Meal registry services like Meal Train allow cancer patients and their caregivers to
                                receive the support they need. By sending out invites to friends and family over email
                                or social media, Meal Train raises awareness of the situation and facilitates
                                volunteerism. Though the platform is able to help people who have already gone through a
                                life-changing event (e.g. a birth or death in the family, recovery from a medical
                                procedure), <span class="highlight">it does not afford the flexibility required for
                                    cancer patients with needs that evolve over time. Therefore, I wanted to alter Meal
                                    Train in a way that better suited the unique physical and emotional challenges that
                                    cancer patients face.</span>

                            <p>To familiarize myself with each stakeholders' needs, I read articles and peer-reviewed
                                journals on what cancer looks like and the role of diet in recovery. I then conducted
                                interviews to hear more about individual experiences living with cancer or supporting
                                someone undergoing treatment.</p>
                            <p>The guiding topic for my secondary research was food handling and nutrition requirements
                                for different types of cancer patients. Because patients typically follow strict eating
                                guidelines set by medical professionals to improve their chances of survival, this is an
                                important area I aimed to emphasize when redesigning Meal Train. The overarching
                                question I wanted to answer within this body of knowledge was <span
                                    class="highlight">“How does nutrition impact the health of cancer patients
                                    undergoing treatment?”</span></p>
                            <p>In general, patients need extra calories to keep their energy levels up during treatment.
                                This can be tricky due to side effects that can prevent patients from wanting to eat.
                                When setting preferences in a redesigned version of Meal Train, it is important that
                                organizers can easily customize dietary requirements. Ways the platform can be tailored
                                towards the needs of patients and caregivers could look like asking what the type of
                                cancer the patient has and the side effects they’re experiencing.</p>

                                <div>Interviews</div>

                            <p>I interviewed two cancer survivors and three people with experience caring for someone
                                with cancer. For cancer survivors, my intent was to learn more about their experience

                                wanted to hear from caregivers and supporters what their role entailed. Two of the three
                                interviewees were friends and family of the patient, while one was a former nurse
                                practitioner who worked in oncology. The interviews were conducted through Zoom and
                                Google Meet, lasting from 30 minutes to an hour.</p>

                            <p>Though I had previously generated design concepts that would build off the current
                                platform, I realized that the changes I had made would potentially get lost in the
                                bigger picture. To reframe the space and better apply research insights, I decided to
                                reimagine the platform as an application that would connect cancer patients to people
                                offering support through meal assistance and conversation. <span
                                    class="highlight">Adding the conversation piece was the most significant change I
                                    made to the platform. This was done primarily to address the patient’s need for
                                    emotional support, especially in a situation like Fiona’s.</span></p>
                            <p>Below are the pages from my sketchbook that capture my thought process. After listing out
                                important takeaways, I categorized cancer patients into two situations: one where they
                                have a dedicated caregiver (e.g. a spouse) helping them, and one with inconsistent
                                support. After thinking through these situations where the organizer of the meal train
                                could either be the caregiver or the patient themselves, I came to the conclusion that
                                Meal Train should have a social aspect involved. Instead of just delivering food,
                                supporters can prepare and share a meal with the patient and caregiver. This idea was
                                formed on the finding that patients were able to make it through their journey knowing
                                that people cared for their wellbeing. I also wanted to make sure the patient living
                                alone was supported while eating. Having a visitor stop by could make it easier to
                                observe whether the patient was getting the nutrition they need.</p>

                            <p>I approached the redesign by drafting Fiona’s story in order to better determine what
                                screens were needed for the stakeholders involved. Following this, I created screens for
                                the app starting from sketches and gradually worked my way toward mid-fidelity mockups.
                                After each round of sketching or wireframing, I tested with participants to understand
                                whether stakeholders would want or need the proposed services of Meal Train. I also
                                wanted to check whether what I was creating could fit within the current ecosystem.</p>
                            <p>The purpose of sketching was to translate my research outcomes into a realistic solution
                                for my stakeholders. Before moving on to mockups, <span class="highlight">my goal was to
                                    lay the groundwork and determine what information and functionality is needed for

                                in a way that aligned chronologically with the way users would interact with the app.
                                During our call, I set the stage for my app by introducing participants to the user
                                story on Fiona. After doing so, I shared my screen and presented the sketches in
                                sections, starting with patient screens and ending with participant visiting screens.

                            <p>I followed the same process as I did for the first round of concept testing.</p>

                                        for.</span> Participants were unsure as to who was updating who and where the
                                    direction of communication was going.</li>
                                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Volunteers, especially if they’re older and not as
                                        “tech savvy,” may struggle using the app.</span> One participant said that
                                    though she would be able to figure it out, she knew of several people who would find
                                    the app tricky to navigate. This is a problem because older people who have the time
                                    and desire to help may be discouraged to do so.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The most important takeaway was that <span class="highlight">my app wouldn’t work for the
                                    intended stakeholders.</span> The functionality was too much all at once, and this
                                proved to be a major hindrance for my testing participants.</p>

                            <blockquote>“The more things that we could handle as volunteers would be good and then they don’t
                                have to think or worry about it. This reminds me of when I had COVID during Christmas
                                and New Years weeks and could barely think straight. I suspect someone receiving chemo
                                would feel the same way. There is no way in the world that I would’ve wanted access to
                                these details.”</blockquote>

                            <p>After both rounds of testing, it was apparent that I had lost sight of who would be
                                interacting with the redesigned Meal Train: organizers and visitors most likely
                                middle-aged or older. Though I had mapped out a clear vision on how users could engage
                                with the app, I had missed the mark on whether my stakeholders would find the app
                                intuitive and easy to use. <span class="highlight">I realized that I needed to define
                                    who the organizer of the app would be as well as simplify the concept

                            </h5>
                            <p>In the user story scenario I gave participants during testing, I wrote it so that Fiona
                                would be both the recipient and the organizer: no Ruth involved. From concept testing, I
                                quickly understood why the current platform assumes that the recipient cannot be the
                                organizer: namely, the physical and emotional burden of whatever the recipient is going
                                through will overpower any desire to advocate for themselves. Because of this, I decided
                                to create a way for patients to stay in the loop without being involved in the
                                intricacies of the meal train itself. Therefore, the recipient needed their own view of
                                Meal Train, separate from the organizer and visitors.</p>
                            <p>Fiona only sees three tabs: Today, Upcoming, and Prayers. That way, she is reminded of
                                who’s showing up from day to day, anticipates who’s coming in the next couple of weeks,
                                and access prayers. She can chat with Ruth at any time by clicking the icon on the top
                                right. Functionality is stripped down to its essence so that Fiona can participate
                                without having to organize it herself.</p>

                            <p>Major changes to the organizer role:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Only Ruth can post status updates on Fiona.</li>
                                <li>Ruth is the only stakeholder with the ability to message Fiona and visitors; she is
                                    the intermediary between them.</li>
                                <li>Ruth cannot see prayers that visitors send. Prayers can be highly personal, and if
                                    the organizer is not close with the recipient, the recipient nor the visitors may
                                    not want the organizer seeing their notes.</li>
                                <li>Settings are for the meal train, not the organizer. In a future iteration, Ruth
                                    could manage multiple trains from this page.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Feedback I received from testing that I hadn’t considered before was difficulty using the
                                app on the visitor side. Before, visitors could expect to see a similar layout as the
                                organizer. My testing participants didn’t believe this to be necessary and thought that
                                the organizer would have to explain the screens to visitors as they onboard onto the
                                app. Though I assumed that there would be a tutorial for all stakeholders when they
                                first see their respective layout, the visitor screens were still too difficult to
                                navigate for some within the age bracket I was targeting. I slimmed down the
                                functionality to include only what visitors needed in order to successfully help Fiona
                                out.</p>
